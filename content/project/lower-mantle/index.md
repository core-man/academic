The core-mantle boundary (CMB) is one of the most important interfaces in the Earth’s interior and plays a key role in the geodynamical evolution of the planet. Many studies have reported existence of ultra-low velocity zones (ULVZs) at the CMB, which are characterized by zones of variable thickness of ∼5–50 km with negative P and S velocity perturbations of 10% or greater. Mapping the geographic presence of ULVZs and their relationship to the surrounding velocity structure would place important constraints on the origin of ULVZs, dynamical and chemical evolution of the Earth’s mantle and origin of the hotspots.

The downwelling displaces the low-velocity region into many low-velocity patches (pink areas) and pushes the ULVZs (red ridge) to the edge of the low-velocity region. The low-velocity region is also surrounded by high-velocity regions, also possibly related to downwellings." >}}

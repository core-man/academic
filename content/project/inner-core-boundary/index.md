The nature of Earth's inner core boundary (ICB) provides key information about the inner core solidification process and the driving forces for thermo-compositional convection in the outer core and the Earth's geodynamo. The traditional views have been that the inner core growing process is geologically slow and geographically uniform, due to the vigorous small-scale convection in the outer core. Recent studies, however, revealed that the ICB is locally enlarged by 0.98–1.75 km beneath Africa between 1993 and 2003, and exhibits significant topography. Therefore, temporal change of inner core surface in the global scale and the longer time scale would give us a better understanding of the evolution of the Earth’s core.

{{< figure src="Africa_ICB.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Temporal change of inner core surface beneath Africa, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean." title="**Figure 1: Temporal change of inner core surface beneath Africa, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean.**" caption="**(a)** Great circle paths from repeating earthquakes (stars) to stations (triangles), PKiKP reflection points at the ICB (purple crosses), PKIKP entry and exit points at the ICB (brown crosses) and PKIKP raypaths in the inner core (black lines). Circles and polygons (purple for PKiKP and brown for PKIKP) indicate approximate groups of similar PKiKP reflection or PKIKP entry/exit points at the ICB (crosses). Heavy blue polygons indicate approximate regions that show temporal change (middle, labeled with change) or no temporal change (left and right, labeled with no change). **(b)** Temporal change of the inner core surface beneath Africa (in the region of the middle heavy blue polygon in Figure 1a). Each small panel lists the repeating earthakes and the temporal changes of the inner core surface between the occurrences of doublets for a region, with the region connected by a black line with the panel. Positive and negative values mean the increase and decrease of inner core radius, respectively. “Unchanged” means no change beyond the detection uncertainty (i.e., travel time residual for PKiKP or PKIKP is zero or within possible total residual error). Events underlined with red solid and blue dashed lines indicate the earliest and latest occurring event in each panel, respectively." >}}

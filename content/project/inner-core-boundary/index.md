The nature of Earth's inner core boundary (ICB) provides key information about
the inner core solidification process and the driving forces for
thermo-compositional convection in the outer core and the Earth's geodynamo.
The traditional views have been that the inner core growing process is
geologically slow and geographically uniform, due to the vigorous
small-scale convection in the outer core. Recent studies, however, revealed that
the ICB is locally enlarged by 0.98–1.75 km beneath Africa between 1993 and 2003,
and exhibits significant topography. Therefore, temporal change of inner core surface
in the global scale and the longer time scale would give us a better understanding
of the evolution of the Earth’s core.

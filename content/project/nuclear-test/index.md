## North Korea’s September 3 2017 nuclear test

### Main test

On 3 September 2017, North Korea conducted the sixth nuclear test, which is the largest.
For details of the source characteristic of the 2017 test, see [Yao et al., 2018a, *SRL*](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/jiayuanyao/publication/yao2018asrl).

### Collapse event 8.5 minutes after the 2017 test

The 2017 test had resulted in an on-site collapse of the Mt. Mantap.
For details of the collapse event after the 2017 test, see [Tian et al., 2018, *GRL*](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/jiayuanyao/publication/tian2018grl).

### Seismicty Triggered by the 2017 test

The 2017 test triggered an earthquake swarm 8.4 km north of the nuclear test site.
For details of the earthquake swarm after the 2017 test, see [Tian et al., 2018, *GRL*](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/jiayuanyao/publication/tian2018grl) and [Yao et al., 2018b, *SRL*](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/jiayuanyao/publication/yao2018bsrl).

Repeating earthquake is a pair of earthquakes, which occur at almost the same location but at different times. This project is to detect global moderate-size (mb > 4.5) repeating earthquakes, which carry great information on internal structure of the Earth and its change with time. This repeating earthquake dataset can be used to study not only temporal changes of medium properties inside the Earth but also the physical mechanisms of deep earthquakes, spatial-temporal variations in fault-slip rate, interplate coupling and recurrence interval.

abstract: |
  We address the uncertainty related to cross-correlation waveform time shift
  measurements, particularly related to temporal changes in inner core seismic
  waves. Details of the cross-correlation measurement, including data processing,
  window length, pick time, sampling rate and the algorithm itself, all affect
  the calculated time shift. By systematically varying measurement parameters
  for a set of earthquake doublets we find time shift uncertainties of 0.01 s
  and 0.02 s for differential times and double differential times respectively.
  The uncertainty is of a similar magnitude to reported double differential times
  of PKIKP and PKiKP inner core phases. Accounting for measurement uncertainty
  results in 80% of values published in a recent study being below the measurement
  resolution (Yang and Song 2020a). While the temporal variations in inner core
  phases is not in dispute, properly accounting for uncertainties is needed
  for robust data interpretation. A re-assessment for the origin of inner core
  temporal changes is therefore warranted and future studies should account
  for measurement uncertainty.

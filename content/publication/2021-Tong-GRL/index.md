abstract: |
  P-wave azimuthal anisotropic tomography reveals that the July 6, 2019 Mw 7.1
  Ridgecrest earthquake occurred in a region with clockwise crustal rotation.
  The rotation together with the sinistral slip on the Garlock Fault is a
  response to the northwest-trending, dextral shear within the Eastern California
  Shear Zone due to the relative motion between the Pacific and North America Plates.
  The hypocentral area of the Ridgecrest mainshock is characterized by a sharp
  lateral velocity contrast which has a reversal in contrast polarity at
  about 5 km depth. We find high Vp/Vs ratio structures covering the rupture
  zones of the Mw 6.4 foreshock and the Mw 7.1 mainshock, which may indicate
  the existence of fluids in the fault zones. We speculate that fluids and
  crustal rotation may have played important mechanical roles in causing
  the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence.

abstract: |
  We report two decades of changing behavior of the Earth's inner core boundary (ICB),
  which provides the simplest explanation for the observed temporal change of the
  compressional seismic waves that are reflected from the ICB (PKiKP) and refracted
  in the inner core (PKIKP), from earthquake doublets occurring in South Sandwich
  Islands between 1993 and 2013. In the early period (before 2003), the ICB is
  enlarged beneath the western coast of Gabon, Republic of Congo, and southwest
  Tanzania in the reflected points of the PKiKP observed at seismic stations OBN,
  AAK, and ARU, while it experiences little change beneath Zimbabwe or/and Kenya,
  and beneath west Angola or/and north Central African Republic, in the PKIKP
  entry or/and exit points of AAK and ARU observations, respectively.
  In the later period (after 1998), the ICB regions beneath the western coast of Gabon,
  Republic of Congo, and southwest Tanzania either shrink or remain unchanged,
  and the temporal change migrates to beneath Zimbabwe or/and Kenya, and
  beneath west Angola or/and north Central African Republic, with a decrease of
  inner core surface by 5.59 km between 1998 and 2009 beneath Zimbabwe or Kenya
  and by 1.73 km beneath west Angola or north Central African Republic between
  1998 and 2013. These results indicate that ICB temporal change occurs in localized
  regions and is episodic, rapidly migrating, and alternately enlarged and shrunk.

abstract: |
  We constrain seismic structure and ultra-low velocity zones near the Earth’s
  core-mantle boundary (CMB) beneath Southeast Asia. We first determine the
  average shear-velocity structure near the CMB in the region based on travel-time
  analysis of S, ScS, P and ScP phases. We then map seismic scattering in the
  lowermost mantle using the PKP precursors observed at the USArray.
  The inferred average shear-velocity perturbations in the lowermost 200 km of
  the mantle range from about −6% to 6%, and exhibit a complex geographic
  distribution of alternate low- and high-velocity patches adjacent to each other,
  surrounded by a high-velocity anomaly in the south. The inferred strong seismic
  scatterers exhibit a crescent shape distributed from the South China Sea to
  the Maluku Islands and coincide with the westernmost low-velocity patch,
  suggesting that the strong scatterers represent ultra-low velocity zones (ULVZs).
  We suggest that the seismic structure in the region likely results from a complex
  interaction between a downwelling and a low-velocity region near the CMB.
  The downwelling (the high-velocity patches) displaces the low-velocity region
  into many low-velocity patches and pushes the ULVZs to the edge of the low-velocity region.

In the upper crust, our model reveals two thick (10 km) N-S-elongated basins between the Indo-Burman Ranges and the Central Myanmar Basin. At middle to lower crustal depths, low velocities dominate the Indo-Burman Ranges, especially in its northern part where Vs is observed to be as low as ∼3.2 km/s in the lower crust. This feature is interpreted as sediments that were deposited west of the ranges and have since been subducted northeastward and accreted onto the overriding plate. Furthermore, our model reveals an N-S trending high-velocity anomaly beneath the Sagaing Fault, which could be explained by solidified basaltic magma that intruded upwards from the mantle where a low-velocity anomaly is imaged.

The interior of the Earth’s inner core exhibits both velocity\nand attenuation anisotropy, and hemispherical variations of velocity,\nattenuation and anisotropy, while the surface of the inner core possesses\ntopography and mushy zone in some localized regions. The inner core velocity\nand attenuation anisotropy is cylindrical with the axis of high velocity and\nhigh attenuation parallel with the Earth’s rotation axis, and depth dependent\nwith the topmost 100–400 km close to be isotropic and the innermost 300–600 km\npossibly possessing a distinct anisotropy. The hemispherical variations\nin the inner core are manifested in many aspects: the isotropic velocity of\nthe topmost ~100 km of the eastern hemisphere is 0.8% faster than that of \nthe western hemisphere, the attenuation in the top ~100 km of the eastern\nhemisphere (Q=250) is stronger than that of the western hemisphere (Q=600),\nthe top isotropic layer is thinner in the western hemisphere (~100 km) than\nin the eastern hemisphere (~400 km), and the inner core anisotropy in the\nwestern hemisphere (~4%) is stronger than in the eastern hemisphere (~0.7%).\nIn the boundary, the inner core exhibits topographic variations with height\nchanges of 1–14 km beneath the Philippine Sea, the Yellow Sea, the western\nPacific and Central America, and a mushy zone with a thickness of 4–8 km\nbeneath the southwest Okhotsk Sea. These new findings have motivated a series\nof new physical mechanisms in the scientific community and demand for\nreevaluation of outer core composition, thermal-compositional convection\nin the outer core, inner core solidification process and driving force of\nEarth’s geodynamo. These results suggest that the inner core solidification\nprocess and the driving force of Earth’s geodynamo are not laterally homogeneous,\nas it has long been held in the traditional views. Solidification may occur in\nthe western hemisphere releasing latent heat and light elements, while melting\nmay occur in the eastern hemisphere absorbing latent heat and light elements.\nTherefore, the driving forces for the outer core convection in these two hemispheres\nmay be different and may even be in opposite signs. Such alternative solidification\nand melting should also occur in the localized topographic regions. Moreover,\nthe solidification in the region of a mushy zone would release both thermal\nand chemical energy, while that in other regions of a sharp inner core boundary\nonly releases thermal energy.\n","tags":[],"title":"Seismic structure and dynamic process of the Earth's inner core and its boundary","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yao Jiayuan","Li Sun","Lianxing Wen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1438473600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438473600,"objectID":"940b7201fe4f695bc46d736e8918cc7d","permalink":"https://core-man.github.io/academic/publication/2015-yao-jgr/","publishdate":"2015-08-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic/publication/2015-yao-jgr/","section":"publication","summary":"We report two decades of changing behavior of the Earth's inner core boundary (ICB),\nwhich provides the simplest explanation for the observed temporal change of\nthe compressional seismic waves that are reflected from the ICB (PKiKP) and\nrefracted in the inner core (PKIKP), from earthquake doublets occurring in\nSouth Sandwich Islands between 1993 and 2013.

We first determine the\naverage shear-velocity structure near the CMB in the region based on travel-time\nanalysis of S, ScS, P and ScP phases. We then map seismic scattering in the\nlowermost mantle using the PKP precursors observed at the USArray.\nThe inferred average shear-velocity perturbations in the lowermost 200 km of\nthe mantle range from about −6% to 6%, and exhibit a complex geographic\ndistribution of alternate low- and high-velocity patches adjacent to each other,\nsurrounded by a high-velocity anomaly in the south. The inferred strong seismic\nscatterers exhibit a crescent shape distributed from the South China Sea to\nthe Maluku Islands and coincide with the westernmost low-velocity patch,\nsuggesting that the strong scatterers represent ultra-low velocity zones (ULVZs).\nWe suggest that the seismic structure in the region likely results from a complex\ninteraction between a downwelling and a low-velocity region near the CMB.\nThe downwelling (the high-velocity patches) displaces the low-velocity region\ninto many low-velocity patches and pushes the ULVZs to the edge of the low-velocity region.\n","tags":[],"title":"Seismic structure and ultra-low velocity zones at the base of the Earth’s mantle beneath Southeast Asia","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Download my full CV here.\n Education  2018: Ph.D. in Geophysics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China 2012: B.S. in Geophysics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China   Academic Positions  2021/11–Present: Associate Professor, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) 2021/04–2021/09: Research Fellow, Earth Observatory of Singapore 2018/08–2021/03: Research Fellow, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"fd36605688ef45e10dc233c860158012","permalink":"https://core-man.github.io/academic/cv/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic/cv/","section":"","summary":"Download my full CV here.\n Education  2018: Ph.D. in Geophysics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China 2012: B.S. in Geophysics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China   Academic Positions  2021/11–Present: Associate Professor, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) 2021/04–2021/09: Research Fellow, Earth Observatory of Singapore 2018/08–2021/03: Research Fellow, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore  ","tags":null,"title":"Curriculum Vitae","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"2023  Apr. 21, 2023: The paper on Rapid along-strike variations of shallow crustal structure in response to Indo-Burma subduction: Constraints from multi-type passive seismic data has been published at Earth and Planetary Science Letters.  2022   Mar. 30, 2022: The paper on Imaging the upper 10 km crustal shear‐wave velocity structure of central Myanmar via a joint inversion of P‐Wave polarizations and receiver functions has been published at Seismological Research Letters.\n  Mar. 18, 2022: The paper on Adjoint tomography of northeast Japan revealed by common‐source double‐difference travel‐time data has been published at Seismological Research Letters.\n  Feb. 21, 2022: The paper on Moho Complexity in Southern California Revealed by Local PmP and Teleseismic Ps Waves has been accepted at Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth.\n  2021   Nov. 1, 2021: Yao Jiayuan joined Institute of Geophysics and Geomatics at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) as an associate professor.\n  Sept. 3, 2021: Yao Jiayuan has finished the contract with Nanyang Technological University.
